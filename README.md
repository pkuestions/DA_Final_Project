# DA_Final_Project
Capstone Project for Ironhack Data Analysis Bootcamp

## Members of the group:
- Paul Kollhof

## Goal of the project:
- create interactive map of Berlin displaying dataof various traffic accidents

## Brief description of used data / libraries:
- datasets: 
	- Berlin traffic accidents data for each year from 2018-2021
	- annual datasets have ~11-13K observations (rows) & ~24 features (columns)
- libraries:
	- geopandas (handling geolocation data in pandas-environment)
	- folium (leafletjs-wrapper for building interactive maps based on openstreetmap api)

## High-level Planning of the project:
- Stage 1
	- EDA of traffic accidents data
	- explore functionalities of geopandas and folium
		- create first mock-maps
		- implement markers, overlays
- Stage 2
	- data cleaning / processing
	- data analysis
- Stage 3
	- visualising data in interactive map
